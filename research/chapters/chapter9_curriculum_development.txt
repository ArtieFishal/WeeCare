                 using time-out.

           (k)   Time-out may be used to intervene with a child whose behavior is disruptive to the
                 group or hurtful to other children and who does not respond to educator redirection or

                 1.    Time-out shall be reasonable and developmentally appropriate and shall not

                 is considered acceptable:

                 1.    Physical touch associated with prompting, comforting, or assisting that does not
                       prevent the service recipient’s freedom of movement or normal access to his or
                       her body.

                 2.    Physical restraint and seclusion are emergency safety interventions, not
                       therapeutic techniques, and are implemented in a manner designed to protect

                       the child/youth is at imminent danger of self-harm or of harming others and no
                       other option exists to protect the safety of the child/youth and staff members.
