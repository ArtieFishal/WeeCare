            (a)   Extended care services may be offered by a child care agency as an additional
                  component to conventional care services, or the child care agency may exclusively
                  provide extended care services.

            (b)   In order for a child care agency to offer extended care services, the Department shall

                  care agency.

            (b)   The policy shall:

                        drug test; and

                  3.    Require drug testing based upon reasonable suspicion that employees, directors,
                        licensees, or operators of a child care agency, or other persons providing
                        services under contract or for remuneration for the agency are engaged in the
                        use of illegal drugs.

            due to a criminal offense or registry listing has the option of requesting a waiver from the

            Operations for Adult and Child Care Licensing.

            (a)   The request for a waiver shall state the basis for the request, including any extenuating
                  or mitigating circumstances that would, in the individual’s opinion, clearly warrant an

                  the request.

            (b)   Requests for waivers shall be reviewed by an advisory committee. A waiver will be
                  granted only if the person can show that extenuating circumstances exist that clearly

                  Department’s Director of Child and Adult Care Licensing of whether to grant or deny
                  the waiver request. The Director has full discretion over the final decision on whether to
                  grant or deny the requested waiver.

            (c)   Any person who is the subject of an exclusion who is dissatisfied with the decision of
                  the Department’s Director of Child and Adult Care Licensing regarding a waiver may
                  appeal such decision in writing to the Department by filing a written request for an
                  appeal with the Department’s Division of Appeals and Hearings within ten (10) days of
                  the date of notice of the denial of the waiver to the individual, and may request an

                  compiled in title 4 chapter 5, part 3 of the Tennessee Code Annotated.

           (i)   Each time a child is engaging in unacceptable behavior the educator shall first redirect
                 the child’s attention and substitute a desirable activity prior to disciplining the child.

           (j)   Less restrictive, positive behavior management techniques shall be employed before
                 using time-out.

           (k)   Time-out may be used to intervene with a child whose behavior is disruptive to the
                 group or hurtful to other children and who does not respond to educator redirection or
                 guidance.

                 1.    Time-out shall be reasonable and developmentally appropriate and shall not
                       include restraint or seclusion.

                 2.    The length of each time-out session shall be based on the age of the child and
                       shall not exceed one (1) minute per each year of age of the child; provided,
                       however, that no child under thirty-six (36) months shall be placed in time out.

                 3.    Time-out shall take place in an appropriate location within sight of the educator.

                 4.    Restraining devices such as high chairs, cribs, or car seats shall not be used for
                       time-out.

                 5.    Redirection or a similar approach shall be used for children younger than thirty-
                       six (36) months of age.

           (l)   Physical Restraint and Seclusion. The following is not considered physical restraint and
                 is considered acceptable:

                 1.    Physical touch associated with prompting, comforting, or assisting that does not
                       prevent the service recipient’s freedom of movement or normal access to his or
                       her body.

                 2.    Physical restraint and seclusion are emergency safety interventions, not
                       therapeutic techniques, and are implemented in a manner designed to protect
                       the child/youth’s safety, dignity, and emotional well-being.

                 3.    The use of physical restraint is allowed only in the case of an emergency when
                       the child/youth is at imminent danger of self-harm or of harming others and no
                       other option exists to protect the safety of the child/youth and staff members.
