# Tennessee CACFP Meal Pattern Requirements Research

## Overview
This document captures key meal pattern requirements and nutrition standards for the Tennessee Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which will be incorporated into our enhanced Nutrition & Meals chapter.

## USDA CACFP Meal Components (7 CFR 226.20)

### Fluid Milk Requirements
- **Children 1 year old**: Unflavored whole milk must be served
- **Children 2-5 years old**: Either unflavored low-fat (1%) or unflavored fat-free (skim) milk
- **Children 6+ years old**: Low-fat (1%) or fat-free (skim) milk, may be unflavored or flavored
- **Adults**: Low-fat (1%) or fat-free (skim) milk, may be unflavored or flavored
- Lactose-free and reduced-lactose milk meeting fat content requirements may be offered

### Meal Pattern Structure
CACFP requires specific meal components based on meal type:
- **Breakfast**: Must include fluid milk, fruits/vegetables, and grains/bread
- **Lunch/Supper**: Must include fluid milk, meat/meat alternate, fruits, vegetables, and grains/bread
- **Snacks**: Must include two of the following: fluid milk, meat/meat alternate, fruits, vegetables, or grains/bread

### Age-Specific Serving Sizes
The CACFP meal patterns specify minimum serving sizes by age group:
- Infants (0-5 months, 6-11 months)
- Children (1-2 years, 3-5 years, 6-12 years)
- Adults (13+ years)

### Key Nutrition Standards
- Greater variety of vegetables and fruits
- At least one serving of whole grains per day
- No grain-based desserts
- No more than 6 oz of juice per day
- No serving fried foods
- No added sugars in yogurt
- Breakfast cereals must contain no more than 6g of sugar per dry ounce

## Tennessee-Specific Requirements
Tennessee follows the federal CACFP guidelines with these additional considerations:
- All meals served must meet USDA nutrition guidelines
- Child Care Centers must sign an agreement with Tennessee DHS to participate in CACFP
- Centers can claim up to two meals and one snack per participant daily
- Meals must meet the recommended serving size and component requirements

## Walmart Grocery Integration Opportunities
- Ability to generate shopping lists based on meal plans
- Integration with Walmart grocery ordering system
- Budget tracking and cost optimization
- Automatic substitution recommendations for out-of-stock items
- Nutritional compliance checking of cart items

## Implementation Priorities
1. Tennessee-compliant meal planning templates by age group
2. Walmart grocery ordering integration
3. Nutritional analysis and compliance tracking
4. Budget management features
5. Printable resources for licensing and internal use

This research will inform the design and implementation of enhanced interactive nutrition and meal planning tools for the Nutrition & Meals chapter.
